# Apache Camel Examples

There are plenty of Apache Camel
[examples in the main repo](https://github.com/apache/camel/tree/master/examples).

However, it is a big repo to clone and has a lot of examples that are probably not relevant and it isn't structured well.

e.g. there is a mix of Spring XML and JavaConfig and several different ways to start an application without a clear progression on which is the recommended way. 

This project aims to extract out some of the more basic examples as an introduction to how Camel works.

This project will use gradle instead of maven that the main Camel repo uses.
